# VGG
The full name of VGG is the Visual Geometry Group, which belongs to the Department of Science and Engineering of Oxford University. It has released a series of convolutional network models beginning with VGG, which can be applied to face recognition and image classification, from VGG16 to VGG19. The original purpose of VGG's research on the depth of convolutional networks is to understand how the depth of convolutional networks affects the accuracy and accuracy of large-scale image classification and recognition. -Deep-16 CNN), in order to deepen the number of network layers and to avoid too many parameters, a small 3x3 convolution kernel is used in all layers.
